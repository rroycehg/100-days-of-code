# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 31, 2021 
##### Rolie

**Today's Progress**: Practiced more ways to apply a forEach() and a for loop to replace target elements of a DOM with my own Array Elements.

**Thoughts:** I feel that for anyone that wants to get into web design or just creating a website needs to play around with manipulating the DOM often to garner skills using Javascript to manipulate the data. Here I felt that usng 2 methods and comparing the two while getting the same results is a good way to build understanding of how things move around. This will come in handy when we wanna create our own JSON servers and make API fetches building a fake website.

### Day 2: Jun 5, 2021 
##### Rolie

**Today's Progress**: Practice maganaging First-Class Functions and higher-order functions

**Thoughts:** After a long busy week with bootcamp I can resume with my 100 days of code challenges. Here, I focused on mainly understanding how different functions interacted with one another. How parameters work as well. Overall, I think it's best go through these first few days of code challenges tackling basics and really take the time to understand how they work as I advance towards tougher material.
